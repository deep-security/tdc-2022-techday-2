Using Amazon EKS, you can deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications that run Kubernetes on AWS.

To eliminate a single point of failure, Amazon EKS runs the Kubernetes management infrastructure across multiple Availability Zones. Amazon EKS is certified Kubernetes-conformant, so you can use existing tools and plugins from partners and the Kubernetes community. Applications that run in a standard Kubernetes environment are fully compatible with this deployment and can be migrated to Amazon EKS.

This Quick Start provides AWS CloudFormation templates that deploy the Kubernetes control plane, connect worker nodes to the cluster, and configure a bastion host for cluster administrative operations. Additionally, this deployment provides several https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/registry.html[AWS CloudFormation registry resource types^] that let you deploy and manage Kubernetes applications by declaring Kubernetes manifests or Helm charts. This Quick Start also includes optional add-ins from AWS Partners and open-source projects. For more information, see the link:#_optional_add_ins[Optional add-ins] section.
