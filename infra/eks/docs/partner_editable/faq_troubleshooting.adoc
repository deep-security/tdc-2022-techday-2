== FAQ


*Q.* I encountered a *CREATE_FAILED* error when I launched the Quick Start.

*A.* If AWS CloudFormation fails to create the stack, we recommend that you relaunch the template with *Rollback on failure* set to *Disabled*. (This setting is under *Advanced* in the AWS CloudFormation console, *Options* page.) With this setting, the stack’s state is retained, and instances remain running so you can troubleshoot the issue.

IMPORTANT: When you set *Rollback on failure* to *Disabled*, you continue to incur AWS charges for the stack. Ensure that you delete the stack when you finish troubleshooting.

For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/troubleshooting.html[Troubleshooting AWS CloudFormation^].

*Q.* A resource type starting with *AWSQS::* failed on stack create, update, or deletion.

*A.* These resources are AWS CloudFormation registry resource types created by the Quick Start. Logs for it are stored in Amazon CloudWatch Logs with a group prefix of */cloudformation/registry/awsqs-*.

*Q.* I encountered a size limitation error when I deployed the AWS CloudFormation templates.

*A.* We recommend that you launch the Quick Start templates from the links in this guide or from another S3 bucket. If you deploy the templates from a local copy on your computer or from a non-Amazon S3 location, you might encounter template size limitations when you create the stack. For more information, see http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cloudformation-limits.html[AWS CloudFormation quotas^].
