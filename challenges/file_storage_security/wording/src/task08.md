# Task 8: Import What? üòï

## DESCRIPTION

Since you can‚Äôt fix the application to stop having vulnerabilities right now, we need to stop the application from returning malware to the user.

To that end, you need to protect the microservice that serves the optimized images from the image bucket. That way, whenever the webpage asks for a file, if it would return malware, it instead ‚Ä¶ doesn't do that.

## DETAILS

In order to protect the microservice, we must find the microservice.

If the Credentials section, you can find a link to the Lambda with the microservice‚Äôs code under ‚ÄúFSSLambdaToProtect.‚Äù Go ahead and navigate to that link.

You‚Äôll see it‚Äôs a Python function that will fetch images from the Image bucket and return them to the rest of the application.

To complete this challenge, enter the first line of code of this Lambda function.

## NOTES

This is just to make sure you‚Äôre on the right page.
