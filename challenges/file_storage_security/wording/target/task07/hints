## HINTS

### HINT 1

You can get your external ID by trying to launch an FSS template from the FSS console, and copying the value from there. Or you can use the FSS api. Your choice.

### HINT 2

If the template isn’t deploying, delete the service catalog and try again, making sure that your region and ExternalID are correct.

### HINT 3

1. Find your external ID by launching a stack from the FSS console and copying the External ID value
2. Fill in the service catalog template, making sure to set ScanOnGetObject to true, region to trend-us-1, bucket to the value of FSSBucketToProtect from the Credentials field of mission control, and the external ID to the external ID from step 1
3. You’re done when the FSS stack is in CREATE_COMPLETE status.
