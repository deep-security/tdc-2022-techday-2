In this challenge, you need to deploy a FSS All-In-One Stack with the ScanOnGetObject feature enabled to protect the bucket that contains all the profile pictures of the SudoSingles™ users.

We would normally do this using the simple CloudFormation template generated in the FSS console, but we can’t do that on Tech Day. So we’re going to use the AWS Service Catalog.

Navigate to the Service Catalog and launch the “File Storage Security All in One Template” product. This is an exact copy of the CloudFormation template from the FSS console.

Configure the stack to protect the bucket found under “FSSBucketToProtect” in the Credentials field below. Also, make sure to enable the ScanOnObject get feature, and to set your region to trend-us-1.

Finally, you’ll need to acquire your FSS external ID to finish launching the AIO stack. I’ll leave this one up to you.

Once the FSS All-In-One Stack is finished deploying, enter “I did it” in the box below, and hit “Submit.”
