In this challenge, you need to deploy an FSS All-In-One Stack with the ScanOnGetObject feature enabled to protect the bucket that contains all the profile pictures of the SudoSingles™ users.

You would normally do this using the quickstart CloudFormation template generated by the FSS console, but you can’t do that on Tech Day. So you’re going to have to use the AWS Service Catalog for today.

Navigate to the Service Catalog and launch the “File Storage Security All in One Template” product. This is an exact copy of the CloudFormation template from the FSS console.

Configure the stack to protect the bucket found under “FSSBucketToProtect” in the "Credentials" field below.

Finally, you’ll need to acquire your FSS external ID to finish launching the All-In-One stack. I’ll leave this one up to you.

To complete this challenge, answer the following question using the box below:

How many entries are in the Events -> Outputs section of the Service Catalog Product you just deployed.
