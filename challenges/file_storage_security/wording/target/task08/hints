## HINTS

### HINT 1

Make sure you've deployed the All In One Stack Service catalog product template with "ScanOnGetObject" set to true, the region set to "trend-us-1", and your ExternalID properly set.

### HINT 2

1. Take note of the "ScannerStackManagementRoleARN" and "StorageStackManagementRoleARN" from the outputs of your provisioned Service Catalog product.
2. Navigate to the FSS console, and click the blue "+ Deploy" button.
3. Click the "Scanner Stack and Storage Stack" option.
4. Paste in the value of "ScannerStackManagementRoleARN" for Step 3 and "StorageStackManagementRoleARN" for Step 4.
5. Click submit and wait for the stacks to deploy successfully.
6. When that has completed, copy the Scanner Stack name found under the "Scanner Stack" heading in the left-hand pane. It should look something like: "SC-############-pp-xxxxxxxxxxxxx-ScannerStack-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
