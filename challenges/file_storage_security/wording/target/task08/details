Navigate to your FSS console and register the stack you just created. You'll add both the Scanner and Storage stack by clicking the "+ Deploy" button and using the outputs from the Service Catalog product.

When you've added your Scanner and Storage stacks to the console, enter the name of the Scanner Stack, as it appears in the FSS console, and hit "Submit" below.
