Navigate back to the SudoSingles™ profile creation page, and you should notice a few things.

First, you don’t get any malware drops anymore! Great.

Second, you should see that several of the images that used to be on the page have been replaced with placeholders. I guess there was more malware in that bucket after all. (if you upload any malicious files, they will also be replaced by placeholders)

Using the ScanOnGetObject feature of File Storage Security, you were able to stop malware in its tracks, simply by changing the name of a bucket. No scanning required. Pretty slick!

To complete this final challenge, enter the number of images that are replaced
