Now that you’ve set up the malicious server, time to run the exploit.

To do this, you have to make a request to http://sudosingles-optimizer. But you’re going to include a specially crafted header to call back to your malicious LDAP server and execute a command.

For this challenge, the command you want to execute inside the sudosingles-optimizer container will reach out to a malicious URL and drop a scary payload onto the filesystem—a payload which will execute whenever a user visits the website.
