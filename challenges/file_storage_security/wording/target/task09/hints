## HINTS

### HINT 1
If you don't have the “ScanOnGetObjectAccessPointARN” entry in Events ⇒ Outputs for your File Storage Security All In One Service Catalog product, redeploy the product with "ScanOnGetObject" set to "true". The ARN will look like: "arn:aws:s3-object-lambda:xx-xxxx-x:xxxxxxxxxxxx:accesspoint/fss-olap-xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"

### HINT 2
The code you have to change is on line 11. Make sure you've activated your FSS stack in the FSS console using the ScannerStackManagementRoleARN and StorageStackManagementRoleARN. Finally, ensure that the ARN is entered correctly into the bucket variable. 

### HINT 3

1. Make sure you have the FSS AIO Service Catalog product deployed successfully with "ScanOnGetObject" set to "true," and that you've added the stack to the FSS console.
2. Copy the ARN from “ScanOnGetObjectAccessPointARN” entry in Events ⇒ Outputs.
3. Navigate to the "FSSLambdaToProtect" URL from the "Credentials" section to be taken to the Lambda code page.
4. Replace line 11 with the following, replacing the ARN with the ARN you copied from step 2: bucket = "arn:aws:s3-object-lambda:xx-xxxx-x:xxxxxxxxxxxx:accesspoint/fss-olap-xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
