SudoSingles™ is an incredibly modern application built by genius engineers.

And as all genius engineers know, microservices are the best thing you can do for an application. Therefore, it should come as no surprise that several interconnected microservices, each delegated to perform a specific task, work together to comprise the SudoSingles™ platform.

One of the main components of SudoSingles™ is a containerized Java microservice that optimizes all images uploaded to the website for display on the web and uploads them all to one big S3 bucket full of profile pictures.

A little birdie has told you that SudoSingles™’s image processing microservice is vulnerable to the Log4Shell attack. Well, you used to moonlight as a "l33t" haxor back in the day, so maybe you can use your skills to verify if that’s true.
