## HINTS

### HINT 1

There are many commands in the terminal that can help you find your hostname… Google is probably your friend here!

### HINT 2

Since this is a Linux system, Google “How to find my hostname on Linux.” There are many ways to do this, but you’ll probably have to run a command in the Terminal Emulator application (found in the bottom bar). Enter the full name (for example: “host-name”).

### HINT 3

1. Open the Terminal application. You can find it on the bar at the bottom of the page.

2. Enter “hostname”

3. The output of this command is the string answer.
